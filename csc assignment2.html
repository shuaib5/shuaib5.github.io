<h2> My Achievement </h2>
<p> I thank almighty Allah that has been with me me throughout my life up to this time 
and I pray he never leave my side. After I graduated from secondary school, I enrolled
 into an Arabic school which looked new and strange to me. My first achievement after then
 was that I put a beautiful smile on my parent face by coming out with the second position 
in my first year in the Arabic school. The journey continues till I graduated from the school
 with a good grade. <i>Alhamdulillah</i>. After I completed my Arabic school, I wrote my JAMB exam and 
I passed well, I sought for admission in Kwara State University, Malete and I was admitted to study
 Library and information science last year. Although it was stressful initially, starting from the screening
 exercise where we all queued under the hot sun, and so on. we were also involved in different registration after
 resumption such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Medical registration</li>
<li>College registration</li>
<li>Departmental registration</li>
<li>Hostel registration</li>
<li>library registration</li>
</ol>
<p>And so on and everything went well.
 <i>Alhamdulillah</i>. I attended lectures and I also involve myself in night classes and tutorials which really helped me 
throughout the year. I wrote my exams both first and second semesters and I did well.<i> Alhamdulillah</i>. And here I am,
 in my second year, the journey continues and I pray Allah guide me through.</p>
